            <p id="marketing">Product and service management relies on technologies to streamline planning, development, and customer relations. Key tools include project management software (e.g., Jira, Trello), customer relationship management (CRM) systems (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot), and product lifecycle management (PLM) tools for end-to-end development. Data analytics (e.g., Tableau), customer feedback tools (e.g., Qualtrics), and digital design platforms (e.g., Figma) provide insights and improve user experience. Other essential technologies include ERP systems (e.g., SAP), AI for decision-making, and customer support software (e.g., Zendesk) to enhance service and support.</p>

            <div class="halver">
                <ul>
                    <li>Inventory control software: Tracks the amount, kind, and value of inventory. Typically uses barcodes or radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to identify and track inventory</li>
                    <li>Partner relationship management software: sales and marketing processes, partners, including recruitment, training, and compliance of channel members</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <p style="margin-top:30px;">Benefits include inventory management and organization of logistics, allowing product quantities to be available in the right place, at the right time. <br> Organized channel management structures will also account for quick product recalls as well as secure communication between channels.</p>
        <p> Ethical channel management centers on fairness, transparency, and respect for partners. This includes fair treatment, open communication about policies and pricing, and respecting partner autonomy without excessive control. Ethical practices also require avoiding conflicts of interest, safeguarding partner data, and promoting environmental responsibility through sustainable practices. Continuous support and improvement are also key, providing resources and addressing issues constructively to maintain strong, trust-based partnerships.</p>

        <h3>Pricing Function</h3>
        <p>"Price is what you pay, value is what you get" -Warren Buffet</p>

        <p>
            Pricing must be fair and not exploit customers or undercut competition. Practices like price-fixing, predatory pricing, and price discrimination are illegal, while others like price skimming must be transparent. <a class="qmark" href="https://blog.counselstack.com/price-discrimination-unfair-pricing-practices-consumer-protections-regulatory-compliance/">i</a><br>
        </p>

            <div class="halver">
                <p>How pricing affects the marketing mix:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>involve determining what goods, services, or ideas to produce or sell that will satisfy customersâ€™ needs  and wants.

                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

            <p>Ethical pricing focuses on fairness and transparency. It involves setting prices that reflect the true value of products without exploiting vulnerable groups and clearly communicating all costs. Businesses should avoid price discrimination and ensure that discounts are genuine. They must also consider social responsibility by making essential goods affordable for low-income customers, especially during crises, and avoid price gouging during emergencies to prevent exploitation.</p>

            Pricing affects promotion decisions in the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choice of medium via promotion: Getting the lowest-cost use of medium compared to maximum exposure</li>

            <li>ways that companies ship their products to their final destination</li>
            <li>Where the product is offered</li>
        </ul>

Companies should respect intellectual property rights, adhere to consumer protection laws, and follow privacy regulations when using customer data. They must also ensure that endorsements are truthful and disclose any material connections.</p>
        <h3>Selling Function</h3>
        <p>Involves communicating with potential customers and pursuing sales leads.</p>
        <p>Sales representatives play an important role in activities such as prospecting, presenting, and closing sales. They can use different types of techniques to cater to their customers' preferences. Modern selling will change with enhanced adaptability and personalization, as AI and social media algorithms become more effective.</p>
        <p>Sales reps will use these techniques:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Prospecting: Identifying potential customers and generating leads. This involves researching potential buyers and reaching out to create sales opportunities.</li>

            <li>Making presentations: Presenting product or service information to potential customers in a persuasive way, focusing on the benefits and solutions the offering provides.</li>

            <li>Closing sales: Finalizing the sale by encouraging the customer to make a purchase decision, often by offering incentives or asking for the order directly.</li>
            <li>Following up: Checking in with customers after the sale to ensure satisfaction, address any further needs, and build long-term relationships for future business.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p style="padding-top:30px;">In order to analytically be effective, techniques such as the following must be used:</p>

            <li>Prioritize high-value online leads: Focusing efforts on leads that are most likely to convert, often identified through data analysis and lead-scoring systems.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br><br><br>
            <p><b>Technologies used in selling:</b><br>Selling utilizes various technologies to enhance efficiency and customer engagement.
